# About the repo

This repo aims to make a simple, fast, effective converter to transform all .ass and .pgssub into .srt because a friend's anime site doesn't accept these formats very well and some connections can't keep up (especially for the pgssub format).

# How it works

For the moment it's very simple, you have to put your mkv in "Todo" and run" ``start.ps1``

<div style="color: rgb(207, 80, 80);">WARNING:</div> This programme is not really very functional yet and only works for a small number of videos with specific characteristics. THE BIGGEST BASE HAS BEEN MADE.

</br>

*PS* : This project is tested on Windows 10, idk if it works on other OS (probably not because the .exe).

# Todo list for to pass in Release 1.0

- [ ] Add documentation 
- [ ] Added the ability to run the project via a terminal command to select the file and not put it in the `todo` folder
- [ ] Try to find another way than going through tkinter to choose a colour easily.
- [ ] Make cleaner comments in the programme
- [ ] Change the name of the output file (whitout the "Clean")
- [ ] Use the temp folder in system
- [ ] Multi OS support (Linux)
- [ ] Make sure that the program does not extract the subtitles if there is already a `.srt` in the mkvfile
  - [ ] Added an optional arg to force it even if there is a .srt in the mkv file
  - [ ] Added an optional arg to choose only sub to convert (useful if there are many sub of several times the same language and you want to convert only one)
  - [ ] Added an optional arg to choose the output folder
  - *probably more arg*

<!-- - [ ] (Optional) Convert all python file to C++ or Rust for faster execution
- [ ] (Optional) Add a GUI
- *[ ] (Optional) Separate entirely from mkvtoolnix* -->
