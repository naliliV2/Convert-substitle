# About the repo

This repo aims to make a simple, fast, effective converter to transform all .ass and .pgssub into .srt because a friend's anime site doesn't accept these formats very well and some connections can't keep up (especially for the pgssub format).

# How it works

For the moment it's very simple, you have to put your mkv in "Todo" and run" ``start.ps1``

<div style="color: rgb(207, 80, 80);">WARNING:</div> This programme is not really very functional yet and only works for a small number of videos with specific characteristics. THE BIGGEST BASE HAS BEEN MADE.

</br>

*PS* : This project is tested on Windows 10, idk if it works on other OS (probably not because the .exe).
